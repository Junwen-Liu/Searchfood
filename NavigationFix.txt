Important Message about React Navigation v5
This project will be using the v4 version of React Navigation and not the v5 version which was released a few months ago. To date, this code still works as expected. The v4 version is still important to know and understand as it is used widely in existing codebases in many organizations. Stephen is aware of the interest in an update and will hopefully post a supplement at some time in the future. In the meantime, I highly encourage you to continue on with the course as it is so that you fully understand how React Navigation works. Once you have finished the course, you can use this is a self-study opportunity to attempt a migration of your finished working projects to v5. The docs provide some great resources on this: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/upgrading-from-4.x/.

1. React Navigation v4 Installation
note: You cannot mix Yarn and npm in the same project as it will break your dependencies. You must consistently use the same package manager. If you have yarn installed on your computer it will be used by default to generate the project. In this case, you must use Yarn to install your dependencies.

1. Install React Navigation

npm install react-navigation

or

yarn add react-navigation

2. Install Dependencies

expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view

3. Install React Navigation Stack

npm install react-navigation-stack @react-native-community/masked-view

or

yarn add react-navigation-stack @react-native-community/masked-view

4. Start the app and clear cache with expo r -c

2. Update Imports
Our imports in the upcoming lecture will now look like this:

import { createAppContainer } from 'react-navigation';
import { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-stack';
